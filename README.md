# Perk-Randomiser-for-Dead-by-Daylight

Having trouble figuring out which perks you want to use in Dead by Daylight? Use this program to get a random combination of perks for either the killer or survivor! Are you up for the challenge? Even if the combination of perks is a lousy one?

You can either check all perks at once and get four random perks, or you can check the perks that you'd like to get mixed up in the randomisation process. You can also check 'Only New Perks Every Roll' to get unique perks for every shuffle.

#### Will be updated once new perks are added to the game.*
